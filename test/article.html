			<h1>Designing for iPhone X Привет</h1>
		</header>
		<section>
			<p>
				iOS 11 marks the introduction of the iPhone X, a much taller iPhone that has virtually no bezel. The 5.8-inch OLED screen is larger than the iPhone 8 Plus’s 5.5-inch, yet the body size is about the same as the iPhone 8. For designers, this means more freedom in our canvas.

			<h2>
				Taller Screen
			</h2>
			<p>
				The extra 145 pt can mean an additional row of content, or the addition of a menu that we once thought was too cramped. That extra space applies to both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus since they share the exact same ratio, despite having different resolutions.
